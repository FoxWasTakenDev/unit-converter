# unitConverter
Hey there! This is my first C++ project on Github. I'm planning on using this to experiment and learn more to work on bigger and better projects in the future.

UNIT - CONVERTER
A simple unit converter that, as of now, can convert various temperature units (Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin)
main.cpp contains the main user interface. temp.cpp and temp.h contain all the mathematical conversion functions, and tempConversions.cpp & tempConversions.h contain the functions that help determine what conversion to use.

Future updates:
1. Units to be displayed (Eg: 273K instead of the 273 it prints now)
2. Length and Speed conversion

Enjoy :)
